NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE (Sensor YourSelf) - Arduino 

In this task we used solar panel to indicate presence of the radiation, output voltage of the solar panel will increase if there is more sunlight falling on the panel. When we go outside where is more sunlight/radiation solar panel will activate the radiation alarm. 

Also we put sensor that measure temperature/humidity, flame alarm, everything we can see in our control station (notebook in this case). 

Emergency button - This button is made of conductive carbon paint, we used gloves as a base for the paint, the gloves represent small part of our sensitive spacesuit. When the button is pushed it sends an information to the space station that turns on a light alarm that indicates the message "Help I am in danger"
